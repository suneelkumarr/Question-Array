# *asic Regex Parser*

Implement a regular expression function isMatch that supports the '.' and ' *'
 symbols. The function receives two strings - text and pattern - and
should return true if the text matches the pattern as a regular
expression. For simplicity, assume that the actual symbols '.' and '* ' do not appear in the text string and are used as special symbols only in the pattern string.

In case you arenâ€™t familiar with regular expressions, the
function determines if the text and pattern are the equal, where the '.'
 is treated as a single a character wildcard (see third example), and
'*' is matched for a zero or more sequence of the previous letter (see
fourth and fifth examples). For more information on regular expression
matching, see the Regular Expression Wikipedia page.

Examples:

```js
input:  text = "aa", pattern = "a"
output: false

input:  text = "aa", pattern = "aa"
output: true

input:  text = "abc", pattern = "a.c"
output: true

input:  text = "abbb", pattern = "ab*"
output: true

input:  text = "acd", pattern = "ab*c."
output: true
```

Constraints:

* [time limit] 5000ms
* [input] string text
* [input] string pattern
* [output] boolean
